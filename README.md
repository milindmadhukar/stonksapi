# Stonks API!

A WIP API which scrapes [Google Finance](https://finance.google.com) to provide with stocks and crypto data and news.


## üíª Endpoints
1. `/stocks/{stock_name}:{stock_index}` - Provides the current price, previous close, market cap and more.
1. `/stocks/news/{stock_name}:{stock_index}` - Provides latest news of the given stock.
1. `/crypto/{crypto_name}:{currency}` - Provides current price, change, previous close and more.



## Ô∏èÔ∏èüõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

This project was written in `Golang`

The API scrapes [Google Finance](https://finance.google.com) using a module called as [Colly](https://github.com/gocolly/colly). 

The API uses [Chi](https://github.com/go-chi/chi) as a router for all its routes.

## ‚õèÔ∏è  Local Setup

To set the project locally, the following steps are to be followed.
1. Clone the repository. Change your working directory to the root of the project where the `go.mod` file is present and run `go mod tidy` to install all the dependencies.
1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and paste the following.
```
PORT = 8000
```
1. Run the command `go run .` to start the api or use `go build .` to create an executable and run that.
1. Visit the url `http://127.0.0.1:8000` and try the endpoints as mentioned in [endpoints](#Endpoints).
